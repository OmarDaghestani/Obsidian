# NIST Special Publication 800-30 Overview

NIST Special Publication 800-30 provides comprehensive guidelines for conducting risk assessments of federal information systems and organizations. It emphasizes the critical role of risk management in safeguarding information technology and informs decision-making processes.

## Purpose and Applicability
*   **Guidance:** Guides federal agencies in conducting risk assessments as part of their overall risk management processes.
*   **Scope:** Applicable to all federal information systems (excluding national security systems).
*   **Encouraged Use:** Encourages voluntary use by state, local, tribal governments, and private sector organizations.
*   **Tiers:** Provides guidance for risk assessments at three tiers:
    *   [[9 Risk Assessments Across Organizational Tiers|Organization-level (Tier 1)]]
    *   [[9 Risk Assessments Across Organizational Tiers|Mission/business process-level (Tier 2)]]
    *   [[9 Risk Assessments Across Organizational Tiers|Information system-level (Tier 3)]]
*   **Mandate:** Applicable to federal information systems as per FISMA and OMB guidelines.

## Target Audience
Designed for diverse risk management professionals:
*   Heads of agencies, risk executives, organizational mission owners.
*   Acquisition officials, information security architects, system evaluators.
*   Individuals with oversight, operational, and monitoring responsibilities.

## [[12 NIST SP 800-30 Related Publications|Related Publications and Frameworks]]
*   Supported by a series of related NIST Special Publications (e.g., [[NIST SP 800-39]], [[NIST SP 800-37]], [[NIST SP 800-53]], [[NIST SP 800-53A]]).
*   Aligns with ISO/IEC standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 27005) for consistency.
*   Promotes reuse of risk assessment results across agencies and contractors.

## Organization of the Special Publication
*   **Chapter Two:** Covers the [[3 Risk Management Process Overview|risk management process]] and terminology.
*   **Chapter Three:** Details the [[4 NIST SP 800-30 Risk Assessment Process|risk assessment process]] (preparation, execution, communication, maintenance).
*   **Appendices:** Glossary, threat sources, risk determination methods.

## Importance of Risk Assessment
*   Essential for understanding and managing information security risks.
*   Ongoing process integrated throughout the system development life cycle.
*   Helps identify potential adverse impacts on operations, assets, and individuals.
*   Supports various risk-based decisions across all organizational tiers.
*   Informs the development of security architectures and selection of security controls.

## Key Concepts
*   [[2 Risk Assessment Key Concepts|Risk]] is a function of adverse impacts and likelihood of occurrence.
*   Information security risks arise from loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
*   [[2 Risk Assessment Key Concepts|Threats]] can be intentional (e.g., cyber attacks) or unintentional (e.g., human error).
*   [[2 Risk Assessment Key Concepts|Vulnerabilities]] can exist in systems, processes, or governance structures.
