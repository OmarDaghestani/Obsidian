# Risk Assessment Key Concepts

Understanding core terminology is fundamental to effective risk assessment.

## Risk
*   Defined as the potential for adverse impacts resulting from [[5 Threat Sources Identification and Taxonomy|threats]] exploiting [[6 Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions|vulnerabilities]].
*   Expressed as a function of adverse [[7 Likelihood and Impact Assessment|impacts]] and [[7 Likelihood and Impact Assessment|likelihood]] of occurrence.
*   Information security risks arise from the loss of **confidentiality**, **integrity**, or **availability** of information and information systems.

## Threats
*   **Definition:** Any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm to an information system or organization.
*   Can be **intentional** (e.g., cyber attacks, insider threats) or **unintentional** (e.g., human error, natural disasters).
*   Categorized in [[1 NIST SP 800-30 Overview|NIST SP 800-30]] into:
    *   **Adversarial:** Individuals, groups, organizations with malicious intent.
    *   **Accidental:** User errors, software bugs.
    *   **Structural:** Equipment failures, infrastructure issues.
    *   **Environmental:** Natural disasters (floods, earthquakes).

## Threat Events
*   **Definition:** The actual occurrence of a threat.
*   Examples: Data breach, malware infection, system outage, natural disaster.
*   Described with Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).

## Vulnerabilities
*   **Definition:** A weakness in an information system, security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source.
*   Can exist in:
    *   **Systems:** Software flaws, misconfigurations.
    *   **Processes:** Weak security policies, inadequate training.
    *   **Governance Structures:** Lack of oversight.
*   Often coupled with **predisposing conditions** that increase their exploitability or impact.

## Likelihood
*   **Definition:** The probability or frequency of a threat event occurring and resulting in an adverse impact.
*   Influenced by:
    *   Threat source capabilities and intent.
    *   Presence and severity of vulnerabilities.
    *   Effectiveness of existing controls.

## Impact
*   **Definition:** The magnitude of harm that could result from a threat event successfully exploiting a vulnerability.
*   Adverse impacts can be categorized as harm to:
    *   Operations (e.g., disruption of services, loss of productivity).
    *   Assets (e.g., loss of data, damage to hardware).
    *   Individuals (e.g., privacy violations, harm to safety).
    *   Other organizations.
    *   The nation.
