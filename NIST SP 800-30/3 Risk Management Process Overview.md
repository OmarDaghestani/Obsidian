# Risk Management Process Overview (NIST SP 800-39)

NIST Special Publication 800-30 operates within the broader context of the organizational risk management process, which is detailed in NIST SP 800-39. This structured approach aims to identify, assess, respond to, and monitor risks.

## Four Key Components:

### 1. Framing Risk
*   **Purpose:** Establish a context for decision-making regarding risk.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Establish risk management strategy.
    *   Define risk tolerance.
    *   Identify internal and external organizational context.
    *   Establish boundaries and assumptions for risk decisions.

### 2. Assessing Risk
*   **Purpose:** Identify and analyze risks to organizational operations, assets, individuals, and the nation.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Identify [[5 Threat Sources Identification and Taxonomy|threat sources]] and potential [[5 Threat Sources Identification and Taxonomy|threat events]].
    *   Identify [[6 Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions|vulnerabilities]] and predisposing conditions.
    *   Determine the [[7 Likelihood and Impact Assessment|likelihood]] of threat events occurring.
    *   Assess the potential [[7 Likelihood and Impact Assessment|impact]] of threat events.
    *   Determine the overall risk.
*   **Key Document:** [[1 NIST SP 800-30 Overview|NIST SP 800-30]] provides the guidelines for this component.

### 3. Responding to Risk
*   **Purpose:** Develop and implement appropriate strategies to address identified risks.
*   **Common Responses:**
    *   **Mitigate:** Implement controls to reduce likelihood or impact.
    *   **Avoid:** Eliminate the risk (e.g., discontinue risky activity).
    *   **Share/Transfer:** Shift risk to another entity (e.g., insurance, outsourcing).
    *   **Accept:** Consciously decide to bear the risk.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Select appropriate security controls (referenced in [[NIST SP 800-53]]).
    *   Develop risk response plans.
    *   Implement controls.

### 4. Monitoring Risk
*   **Purpose:** Ensure ongoing effectiveness of risk responses and adapt to changes in the environment.
*   **Activities:**
    *   [[10 Continuous Monitoring and Risk Assessment Updates|Continuously monitor]] security controls and risk factors.
    *   Evaluate compliance with security requirements.
    *   Detect changes in the information system, operating environment, or threat landscape.
    *   Update risk assessments as needed.
