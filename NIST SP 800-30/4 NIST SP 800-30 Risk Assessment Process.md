# NIST SP 800-30 Risk Assessment Process

The risk assessment process detailed in NIST SP 800-30 is a systematic approach to identifying, analyzing, and managing information security risks. It consists of four main steps: preparation, conducting the assessment, communicating results, and maintaining the assessment.

## 1. Preparing for the Risk Assessment
*   **Purpose:** Establish the context and parameters for the assessment.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   **Identify Purpose:** Clearly define what the assessment aims to achieve.
    *   **Define Scope:** Specify the organizational applicability, systems, boundaries, and time frame.
    *   **Document Assumptions & Constraints:** Record factors that guide or limit the assessment (e.g., available resources, existing controls assumed to be effective).
    *   **Identify Information Sources:** Determine where data for threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts will come from (e.g., threat intelligence, previous audit reports, system documentation).
    *   **Determine [[11 Risk Models and Analysis Approaches|Risk Model & Analytic Approach]]:** Choose the methodology (quantitative, qualitative, semi-quantitative) and the specific risk model to be used.

## 2. Conducting the Risk Assessment
*   **Purpose:** Produce a prioritized list of information security risks.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   **Identify and Characterize [[5 Threat Sources Identification and Taxonomy|Threat Sources]]:**
        *   Identify relevant threat sources (adversarial, accidental, structural, environmental).
        *   Characterize their capabilities, intentions (for adversarial), and range of effects (for non-adversarial).
    *   **Identify Potential [[5 Threat Sources Identification and Taxonomy|Threat Events]]:**
        *   List credible threat events that could be initiated by identified sources.
        *   Assess their relevance to the organization.
    *   **Identify [[6 Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions|Vulnerabilities]] & Predisposing Conditions:**
        *   Discover weaknesses in systems, processes, and controls.
        *   Identify conditions that make exploitation more likely or impact more severe.
    *   **Determine [[7 Likelihood and Impact Assessment|Likelihood]] of Threat Events Occurring:**
        *   Assess the probability of threat event initiation and successful exploitation.
        *   Consider threat capabilities, vulnerabilities, and existing controls.
    *   **Assess Potential [[7 Likelihood and Impact Assessment|Impacts]] of Threat Events:**
        *   Evaluate the magnitude of harm (adverse effects) on operations, assets, individuals, and the nation.
        *   Consider loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
    *   **Calculate Overall Risk:** Combine likelihood and impact assessments using the chosen risk model to determine the risk level (e.g., high, medium, low).

## 3. Communicating and Sharing Risk Assessment Results
*   **Purpose:** Ensure decision-makers have the information needed for informed risk response.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   [[8 Risk Assessment Reports and Communication|Communicate results]] through various formats (reports, briefings).
    *   Share risk-related information with appropriate personnel (e.g., risk executives, system owners, security managers).
    *   Inform risk response decisions and control selections.

## 4. Maintaining the Risk Assessment
*   **Purpose:** Keep the risk assessment current and relevant.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   [[10 Continuous Monitoring and Risk Assessment Updates|Conduct ongoing monitoring]] of risk factors (threats, vulnerabilities, controls, environment).
    *   Update risk assessments based on monitoring results, lessons learned, and significant changes in the organization or its environment.
    *   Ensure assessments remain effective in guiding risk management decisions.
