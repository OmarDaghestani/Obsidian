# Risk Assessment Reports and Communication (NIST SP 800-30)

Effective communication of risk assessment results is vital for informed decision-making and overall risk management. NIST SP 800-30 emphasizes clarity and comprehensiveness in reporting.

## Objectives of Communication
*   Ensure decision-makers (e.g., agency heads, risk executives, system owners) have access to necessary risk-related information.
*   Support risk response formulation and prioritization.
*   Enhance organizational awareness of information security risks.
*   Facilitate ongoing risk monitoring and management.

## Essential Elements of Risk Assessment Reports

A comprehensive risk assessment report should include the following critical components:

### 1. Executive Summary
*   **Purpose:** Provide a high-level overview for senior leadership and those who need quick insights.
*   **Content:**
    *   **Assessment Date:** When the assessment was completed.
    *   **Purpose of Assessment:** A concise statement of why the assessment was conducted.
    *   **Scope of Assessment:** What was included/excluded (e.g., specific systems, departments, timeframes).
    *   **Overall Risk Level:** A summarized risk posture (e.g., overall residual risk is moderate).
    *   **Number of Identified Risks:** Quantification of risks at each relevant level (e.g., X high risks, Y moderate risks).
    *   **Key Findings/Recommendations:** A brief summary of the most significant risks and proposed responses.

### 2. Main Body of the Report
*   **Purpose:** Provide detailed findings, analysis, and supporting context.
*   **Content:**
    *   **Assessment Methodology:**
        *   Description of the risk assessment purpose, scope, and assumptions.
        *   Identification of information sources used.
        *   Description of the [[11 Risk Models and Analysis Approaches|risk model]] and analytic approach employed (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, semi-quantitative).
    *   **Risk Tolerance/Acceptance:** Discussion of the organization's risk tolerance and acceptance criteria.
    *   **Detailed Risk Findings:**
        *   Identification and characterization of [[5 Threat Sources Identification and Taxonomy|threat sources]].
        *   Description of [[5 Threat Sources Identification and Taxonomy|threat events]] and their relevance.
        *   Identification and severity of [[6 Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions|vulnerabilities]] and predisposing conditions.
        *   Assessment of [[7 Likelihood and Impact Assessment|likelihood]] of threat events occurring.
        *   Assessment of potential [[7 Likelihood and Impact Assessment|impacts]] of threat events.
        *   **Risk Determination:** Overall risk levels for identified risks (e.g., using risk matrices).
        *   **Uncertainties:** Acknowledgment and discussion of any uncertainties in the assessment.
    *   **Approaches to Informing Risk Response:**
        *   Methods for refining risk assessment results to prioritize risks (e.g., considering immediate/future impacts, cumulative impacts, relationships among risks).
        *   Preliminary risk response options considered (e.g., mitigate, avoid, accept, share).

### 3. Appendices
*   **Purpose:** Provide supporting documentation and additional details.
*   **Content:**
    *   **References:** List of all documents, standards, or guidelines cited.
    *   **Assessment Team Details:** Names and roles of individuals involved in the assessment.
    *   **Supporting Evidence:** Raw data, detailed calculations, interview notes, or other evidence used to support the assessment findings.
    *   **Glossary of Terms:** Definitions for technical or specific terms used in the report.
    *   **Templates:** Any specific templates used for data collection or analysis.

## Communication Methods
*   **Reports:** Formal written documents for detailed review.
*   **Briefings:** Oral presentations for quick dissemination and discussion, especially for executive leadership.
*   **Dashboards/Visualizations:** For ongoing monitoring and easy understanding of risk posture.
*   **Regular Meetings:** For continuous dialogue and updates on risk status.
